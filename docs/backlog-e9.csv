2000,Epic,EPIC E9: SOTA Reverse Engineering Acceleration,blocked,,P0,critical,XL,codex,type:epic|epic:E9|roadmap:e9|lane:all|phase:frontier,All E9 stories (S1-S8) are completed with passing gates | E9 dependency graph executes without unresolved blockers | Frontier capability delta is published with evidence references,Post-RC frontier implementation program to deliver SOTA reverse-engineering capabilities from the deep-research corpus.
2001,Story,E9-S1: Build whole-program knowledge graph and deterministic index,ready,2000,P0,high,L,codex,type:story|epic:E9|roadmap:e9|lane:backend-data|phase:frontier,Graph schema includes function/global/type/string/import/edge entities | Index build is deterministic and reproducible on fixed input | Query API returns provenance-linked nodes and edges,Type: Story. Epic: E9. Foundation for intent queries and mission orchestration.
2002,Story,E9-S2: Implement intent-level query and similarity retrieval service,open,2000,P0,high,L,codex,type:story|epic:E9|roadmap:e9|lane:ml-backend|phase:frontier,Intent query API returns ranked function candidates | Similarity search supports local and corpus scopes | Recall/latency benchmarks are captured in eval artifacts,Type: Story. Epic: E9. Build analyst-facing intent and similar-function retrieval.
2003,Story,E9-S3: Ship evidence-backed auto-annotation proposal engine,open,2000,P0,critical,L,codex,type:story|epic:E9|roadmap:e9|lane:backend-security|phase:frontier,Proposals include xrefs/constants/callsites/trace evidence bundle | Confidence plus alternate hypotheses are attached to each proposal | Every accepted mutation is reversible with receipt chain integrity,Type: Story. Epic: E9. Replace ad-hoc renaming/comments with auditable proposal generation.
2004,Story,E9-S4: Add advanced type recovery lifecycle and propagation,open,2000,P0,high,L,codex,type:story|epic:E9|roadmap:e9|lane:ml-backend|phase:frontier,Type inference combines deterministic and learned signals | Lifecycle/conflict states are enforced before propagation | Propagation metrics and rollback behavior are tested end-to-end,Type: Story. Epic: E9. Turn inferred types into safe scalable type operations.
2005,Story,E9-S5: Integrate dynamic-static fusion overlays and trace attribution,open,2000,P1,high,M,claude,type:story|epic:E9|roadmap:e9|lane:debugger-data|phase:frontier,Runtime traces map to static graph entities with stable IDs | Hotpath/branch evidence overlays are visible in analysis outputs | Trace ingestion is reproducible and covered by regression tests,Type: Story. Epic: E9. Fuse runtime behavior with static analysis context.
2006,Story,E9-S6: Implement deterministic autopilot crews (triage/protocol/diff/deobf),open,2000,P0,critical,L,codex,type:story|epic:E9|roadmap:e9|lane:ml-plugin|phase:frontier,Mission runner executes deterministic stage graph with checkpoints | Each crew emits machine-readable artifact bundle and receipts | Failed mission stages are resumable without corrupting analysis state,Type: Story. Epic: E9. Deliver mission-style workflows instead of ad-hoc chat operations.
2007,Story,E9-S7: Build cross-binary learning codebook and transfer engine,open,2000,P1,high,L,codex,type:story|epic:E9|roadmap:e9|lane:backend-security|phase:frontier,Approved artifacts sync into corpus with provenance and ACL checks | Transfer suggestions include confidence and source lineage | Offline/allowlist/cloud policy modes are enforced on sync and retrieval,Type: Story. Epic: E9. Make Reverend improve with each analyzed binary.
2008,Story,E9-S8: Deliver spec extraction and PR-grade review packet workflow,open,2000,P0,high,M,claude,type:story|epic:E9|roadmap:e9|lane:plugin-collab|phase:frontier,Spec extraction outputs versioned schema/artifact files | Review packets include inline evidence and acceptance/rejection actions | End-to-end benchmark run validates operator workflow from binary to reviewed spec,Type: Story. Epic: E9. Convert analysis into shareable blueprint artifacts with reviewer governance.
