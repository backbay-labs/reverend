Epic: E21. Deliver the full operator loop from query to proposal review/apply/rollback with receipt chain evidence.
3206,Story,E21-S6: Add benchmark/latency quality gates for operational claim,open,3200,P0,critical,L,codex,roadmap12w|type:story|epic:E21|roadmap:e21|lane:eval-gating|phase:sota-operational,Benchmark slices measure ranking quality and operator workflow completion metrics | Gate/CI fails when regression exceeds configured threshold bands | Artifacts publish baseline-vs-current deltas with reproducible manifests,Type: Story. Epic: E21. Enforce measurable quality/latency thresholds for the operational assistant path in gates and CI.
