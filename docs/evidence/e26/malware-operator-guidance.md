# Malware Operator Guidance (E26)

## Allowed Environments

- Isolated malware sandbox workers only.
- Air-gapped analysis projects with `offline` policy mode.
- Controlled TI-enrichment projects with `allowlist` policy mode and explicit endpoint list.

## Denied Actions

- Running malware binaries on developer workstations or production hosts.
- Using `cloud` policy mode for malware mission execution.
- Adding wildcard allowlist destinations (for example `*`, `*.example.com`, `0.0.0.0/0`).
- Exporting raw sample binaries outside approved artifact stores.

## Escalation Paths

- Suspected uncontrolled egress: page Security on-call and move project policy to `offline` immediately.
- Suspicious sandbox breakout indicators: isolate worker, preserve telemetry, open incident with Security and Ops.
- Provenance or evidence-chain gaps: halt IOC publication and request analyst review.

## Incident Handling

1. Freeze the affected mission run and archive run metadata.
2. Preserve logs, traces, and receipt/evidence artifacts.
3. Re-run policy validation:
   - `python3 scripts/security/validate_malware_safety_profiles.py --profiles scripts/security/malware_safety_policy_profiles.json`
4. Re-run abuse suite for egress/policy controls:
   - `python3 scripts/security/run_abuse_scenario_suite.py --issue-id 3701`
