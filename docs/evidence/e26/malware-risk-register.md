# Malware Domain Pack Risk Register

| Risk ID | Description | Severity | Mitigation | Owner | Review Date | Rollback Trigger |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| MR-01 | False-positive behavior mapping from shared unpacking stubs | Medium | Require evidence-linked behavior map rows (`evidence_refs` >= 2 for high-confidence mappings) | Security | 2026-03-15 | False-positive triage labels exceed baseline + 0.02 |
| MR-02 | IOC contamination from sandbox artifacts instead of payload behavior | High | IOC bundle generation requires sample-scoped evidence URIs and excludes host-generated bootstrap noise | Threat Intel | 2026-03-08 | Any IOC without sample evidence provenance |
| MR-03 | Unsafe malware handling through cloud-profile drift | Critical | Enforce `offline`/`allowlist` only via `validate_malware_safety_profiles.py`; reject `cloud` mode | Security | 2026-03-01 | Profile validation failure |
| MR-04 | Operator runs detonation outside isolated environment | Critical | `detonation_only_in_sandbox=true` in all malware profiles; operator checklist blocks local-host execution | Operations | 2026-03-01 | Any detonation job without sandbox profile hash |
